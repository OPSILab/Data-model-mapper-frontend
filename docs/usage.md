# Data model mapper GUI

## Introduction

The Data model mapper GUI is a graphic user interface for the Data model mapper.
The Data model mapper functionalities are explained in [Data model mapper Readme](../Readme.md)

## Home

The section **Home** is where you can see all mapper records

![](images/home.png)

By clicking the button in the column **Actions** you can see a menu. If the status of the record is *Under development* you can see three options: 

![](images/home-actions-menu.png)

- *Edit record*. You'll be redirected in the mapper editor section and you can edit the record
- *Register*. You'll set the status of the record to *Completed*
- *Delete*. The record will be deleted.

 If the status of the record is *Completed* you can see two options:

 ![](images/home-actions-menu-2.png) 

- *Transform*. You can try the record with an input file
- *Deregister*. You'll change the status to *Under development*

If you click *Transform*, a dialog with two accordion will appear.

## Source

In the *Source* accordion, you'll see the csv input editor for sourceDataType csv

## Source

In the **Source** accordion you can import a source file or edit it.

![](images/source-1.png)

![](images/csv-textarea.png)

If you prefer a table view, click on **CSV TABLE**

![](images/csv-source.png)

If your table is not formatted properly, you must change the colon separator with the one present in your source file

![](images/separator.png)

- *Preview*.  A read only JSON map record preview

**Code** and **View** are the same as source editor.

If you imported the schema or you selected it from the select menu, you can start mapping your output subfield.

If you selected **Code** you can write manually the mapper settings as explained in [Data model mapper Readme](../Readme.md).

If you selected **Tree** mode, you can click next to the key subfield , on the **value** input field, and you can manually map the subfield there by texting it.
